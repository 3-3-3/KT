    "\n",
    "The Agate project is meant to produce populations of LISA binaries that include mass transferring systems, which have been excluded from other COSMIC galaxy populations. While the eventual goal is a whole galaxy population, right now we are working with 9 fixed populationis: 3 for the bulge, 3 for the thin disk, and 3 for the thick disk. It should be noted that this is not really representative because each component contains different amounts of mass! Specifically, the bulge has a mass of $8.9x10^9 M_{\\odot}$, the thin disk has a mass of $4.32x10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, and the thick disk has a mass of $1.44x10^{10} M_{\\odot}$. This is a problem for when we generate the full galaxy thoughâ€“no big deal right now. \n",

It also gives a random seed to be used: this should be changed each time cosmic-pop is run if we want different populations! Additionally, if we want to sample the stellar formation history correctly, we need to change SF_start (10000 for the bulge, 11000 for the thick disk, and 10000 for the thin disk) and SF_duration (1000 for the bulge, 1000 for the thick disk, and 10000 for the thin disk). The parameters --final-kstar1 and --final-kstar2 tell COSMIC a range of systems to keep: 10-12 keeps all the double white dwarf systems. Finally, -n tells COSMIC how many threads to used. I have found using four is the fastest on the Barnes 262 iMacs. \n",

I have saved them on my computer in the directory Agate/Fixed_Pops, which has the subdirectories Bulge, thinDisk, and thickDisk.
